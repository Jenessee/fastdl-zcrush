Background: Foxriver Prison serves as a 
solitary one. It's not Alcatraz by any means; 
just housing individuals deemed not dangerous, 
but just unstable enough to be deemed not safe 
to be released back into society.

When communication outside the island ceased, 
the guards felt uneasy. Their suspicions were only 
confirmed when their monthly drop of supplies 
didn't arrive. The infection reports around the world 
didn't help either.

In a hurry, and without the prisoners, the guards 
left the island at midnight on the only boat they had. 
By the time the prisoners got out of their cells, it was 
too late. The guards were gone and the sun has 
begun to rise once again, with the only sounds being 
the slight singing of the birds and the growling and 
screams in the distance...
